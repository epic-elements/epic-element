              <p>ZEAL Optics is proud to announce an exciting new contest in partnership with Endurance Corner, world-renowned triathlete and ZEAL Ambassador Justin Daerr and Strava. We are gearing up to get you out and cranking on your bike for the next two weeks, and throwing in the opportunity to win one of six pairs of ZEAL Performance sunglasses as we inspire you to #ExploreMore from your bike’s saddle.</p>
              <p>The competition starts Monday, July 18 and ends July 31. The winners of each category will win a pair of ZEAL Optics Performance sunglasses, designed and tested in the cycling mecca of Boulder, Colorado. ZEAL’s plant-based eyewear, like the city they're created in, are built for life outdoors, to help you push your limits, and tirelessly refined by athletes like Justin Daerr to ensure the road ahead is your only focus.</p>
